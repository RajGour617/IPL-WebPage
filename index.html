    <p>The <strong>Indian Premier League (IPL)</strong>, also known as the <strong>TATA IPL</strong> for sponsorship
      reasons, is a men's
      T20 cricket league held annually in India. Founded by the BCCI in 2007, the league features ten city-based
      franchise teams. The IPL usually takes place during the summer, between March and May each year. It has an
      exclusive window in the ICC Future Tours Programme, resulting in fewer international cricket tours occurring
      during the IPL seasons.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="box1" class="box2">
    <p>The IPL is the most popular cricket league in the world; in 2014, it ranked sixth in average attendance among all
      sports leagues. In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event to be broadcast live on YouTube. Inspired by the
      success of the IPL, other Indian sports leagues have been established. In 2022, the league's brand value was
      estimated at ₹90,038 crore (US$11 billion). According to the BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹1,150 crore
      (US$140 million) to India's GDP. In December 2022, the IPL achieved a valuation of US$10.9 billion, becoming a
      decacorn and registering a 75% growth in dollar terms since 2020 when it was valued at $6.2 billion, according to
      a report by the consulting firm D and P Advisory. Its 2023 final became the most streamed live event on the
      internet, with 32 million viewers.</p>

    <h2>Inspired by a rival</h2>
    <p>In 2007, Zee Entertainment Enterprises founded the Indian Cricket League (ICL). The ICL was not recognized by the
      Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) or the International Cricket Council (ICC). Moreover, the BCCI was
      unhappy about its committee members joining the ICL executive board. In response, the BCCI increased the prize
      money for its domestic tournaments and imposed lifetime bans on players who joined the rival league, which it
      considered a rebel league.
    </p>

    <h2>Foundation</h2>
    <p>On 13 September 2007, following India's victory at the 2007 T20 World Cup, the BCCI announced a franchise based
      Twenty20 cricket competition known as the Indian Premier League. The inaugural season was scheduled to start in
      April 2008, commencing with a "high-profile ceremony" in New Delhi. BCCI Vice-president Lalit Modi, who led the
      IPL initiative, provided details of the tournament, including its format, prize money, franchise revenue system,
      and squad composition rules. The league, to be managed by a seven-man governing council, would also serve as the
      qualifying mechanism for that year's Champions League Twenty20.
    </p>

    <p>To determine team ownership, an auction for the franchises was held on 24 January 2008. The reserve prices for
      the eight franchises totalled $400 million, but the auction ultimately raised $723.59 million. The league
      officially commenced in April 2008, featuring Chennai Super Kings (CSK), Mumbai Indians (MI), Delhi Daredevils
      (DD), Kings XI Punjab (KXIP), Deccan Chargers (DC), Rajasthan Royals (RR), Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), and Royal
      Challengers Bangalore (RCB).
    </p>

    Following the ban on players who chose to participate in the ICL, the rival league shut down in 2009.

      </h1><img src="ipl.jpg" style="border-radius:50%" height="110px" width="105px"></img>
      The IPL has several rules which vary from the established Laws of cricket or those used in other Twenty20 leagues:
      <ul>
        <li>IPL games incorporate television timeouts. Each team is given a two-and-a-half-minute "strategic time-out"
          during each innings. One must be taken by the bowling team between the seventh and ninth overs and the other
          by the batting team between the 14th and 16th overs. A penalty may be imposed if umpires find teams misusing
          this privilege.</li>
        <li>Since the 2018 season, the Decision Review System (DRS) has been used in all IPL matches, allowing each team
          two opportunities each innings to review an on-field umpire's decision. From the 2023 season, this was
          extended to allow the review of wides and no-balls.</li>
        <li>If the bowling team does not complete its overs in the allocated time, it may place only four fielders
          outside of the fielding restrictions circle for the remainder of the innings, or the match referee may impose
          financial sanctions on the bowling team after the match, with players fined a proportion of their match fee.
        </li>
        <li>Teams can use a substitute, termed an "impact player", from a list of five players named as possible
          substitutes. The substitution can be made before the start of the innings, when a wicket falls when a batter
          retires or at the end of an over. Both teams can introduce a substitute once per match.</li>
        <li>Teams can declare their playing eleven to the match referee before or after the toss.</li>
        <li>A five-run penalty is imposed if a fielder or wicket-keeper makes an unfair movement while the bowler is
          bowling and the ball is designated as dead ball.
          Teams can include four overseas players in their playing eleven.</li>
        <li>Teams must include 25 players, with a maximum of eight overseas players.</li>
        <li>From the 2024 season, bowlers will be allowed to deliver two bouncers an over. This change in playing
          conditions was trialled during the 2023–24 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, India's domestic T20 tournament.</li>
      </ul>

        <font color="Yellow">Prize money</font>
      </h1><img src="prize money.jpg" height="100px" width="120px"></img>
      The 2022 season of the IPL offered total prize money of ₹46.5 crore (equivalent to ₹49 crore or US$6.2 million in
      2023), with the winning team netting ₹20 crore (equivalent to ₹21 crore or US$2.7 million in 2023) and the
      second-placed team ₹13 crore (equivalent to ₹14 crore or US$1.7 million in 2023). League rules mandate that half
      of any prize money must be distributed amongst the franchise's players.

      <h3><u>Orange Cap</u></h3><img src="IPL-Orange-Cap.webp" width="75px" height="50px"></img>
      The Orange Cap, introduced in 2008, is awarded to the highest run-scorer at the end of each season. It is an
      ongoing competition with the current highest-run scorer wearing the cap whilst fielding. The eventual winner keeps
      the cap for the season. Brendon McCullum was the first player to wear the Orange Cap and Shaun Marsh the inaugural
      winner of the award. Australian batsman David Warner has won the award three times, more than any other player.
      Shubman Gill of Gujarat Titans, who scored 890 runs during the 2023 season, is the most recent winner of the
      award.

      <h3><u>Purple Cap</u></h3><img src="Purple-cap.jpg" width="65px" height="50px" </img>
      The Purple Cap is awarded to the highest wicket-taker at the end of each season. It is an ongoing competition and
      the bowler who is the leading wicket-taker wears a purple cap whilst fielding. The leading wicket-taker at the end
      of the season wins the award. Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Dwayne Bravo and Harshal Patel are the only players to have won
      the award twice.

      <h3><u>Most Valuable Player</u></h3>
      The Most Valuable Player award, called the "Man of the Tournament" until the 2012 season, is awarded using a
      ratings system introduced in 2013. Sunil Narine won the award in 2024.

      <h3><u>Fair Play Award</u></h3>
      The Fair Play Award is given after each season to the team considered to have the best fair play record. After
      each match, the two on-field umpires and the third umpire score the performance of both teams, with the
      highest-scoring team at the end of the season receiving the award. The 2024 winners were Kolakata Knight Riders.

      <h3><u>Emerging Player Award</u></h3>
      The Emerging Player Award was presented to the best under-19 player in 2008 and the best under-23 player in 2009
      and 2010. In 2011 and 2012, the award was known as "Rising Star of the Year," and in 2013 the "Best Young Player
      of the Season." Since 2014, the award has been called the Emerging Player of the Year. Mustafizur Rahman is the
      only foreign player to win this award. The 2024 winner was Nitish Kumar Reddy.

      <h3><u>Maximum Sixes Award</u></h3><img src="six.jpg" width="78px"></img>
